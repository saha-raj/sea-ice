            <p>Arctic sea ice has been declining dramatically in recent decades due to climate change. This visualization shows the changing extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic from 2012 to 2025, based on satellite observations. </p>
            
            <p>The <a href = 'https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/sea-ice-concentration/amsre-amsr2/'>data</a> visualized here is monthly averaged sea ice extent obtained from The Institute of Environmental Physics, University of Bremen, Germany.</p>

            <h2>Arctic Amplification</h2>
        
            <p>The Arctic, being mostly covered by ocean, has responded much more dramatically to climate change. The large variation in seasonal sea ice cover, and the interaction between heat carrying ocean currents and sea ice has amplified warming in the Arctic.</p>
        
            <p>Sea ice is a major factor in the climate response because of its high reflectivity (albedo) and its insulating effect on the ocean's heat capacity. Arctic sea ice concentration and extent has been steadily declining in recent years and it is believed that in a matter of decades the Arctic would be completely ice free in the summer. </p>
        
            <p>As declining sea ice exposes darker ocean, it absorbs more solar radiation and further accelerates warming. This induces a positive feedback, and a tipping point beyond which sea ice would not be able to recover.</p>

            <p>Besides its importance to the global climate, Arctic sea ice is crucial to the marine and terrestrial ecosystems in significant ways.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>The Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Sea Ice</h2>
        
            <p>The Antarctic, in contrast to the Arctic, is mostly land surrounded by vast oceans. The presence of land and the persistent ice sheets on it result in less direct local climatic amplification. However, changes in the surrounding ocean currents and gradual heat percolating underneath the ice shelves have resulted in dramatic changes in recent decades, with parts of multiple ice shelves breaking off. </p>
        
            <p>The loss of sea ice in the Antarctic, though slower than in the Arctic, is likely to have significant amplifying effects on the stability of ice shelves and ice sheets, which in turn have significant implications for global sea level rise and climate.</p>

            <h2>Sea Ice and Past Climate Change</h2>
            
            <p>There is evidence, both observational and modeling, that suggest that sea ice played a key role in the past climate of Earth, particularly the 100,000 year glacial-interglacial cycles and the 1,500 year Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. </p>

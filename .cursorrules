# Sea Ice 3D Visualization Project Guidelines

## Overall Goals
- Create a 3D visualization of sea ice extent using THREE.js and d3.js
- Use existing sea ice GeoJSON data from data/seaice_geojson/_all/[yyyy]-[mm].json
- Structure and position the visualization container exactly like the existing media-container
- Enable the animation to play automatically when in viewport

## Working Guidelines
- DO NOT overcomplicate the problem
- ONLY follow the user's directions and instructions, do not make assumptions or add features not explicitly requested
- Do ONLY what is asked, nothing more, nothing less
- Be careful not to break existing functionality that works
- ASK questions when not sure about any aspect of implementation
- Focus on clean, simple, and maintainable code
- Test incremental changes to ensure proper functioning
- do no jump to conclusions, if there is an issue you're trying to resolve, first DIAGNOSE WHY it is happening, then PROPOSE a solution. ONLY WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN THE GO-AHEAD, THEN IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION.

## Implementation Priorities
1. Implement core visualization correctly first
2. Ensure proper integration with existing site structure
3. Optimize for performance as needed
4. Make sure animation responsively works on all viewport sizes
